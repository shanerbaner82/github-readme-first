Privacy Policy for Readme First

Last updated: December 3, 2025

Overview

Readme First is a browser extension that repositions README content above the file listing on GitHub repository pages. This privacy policy explains how
the extension handles user data.

Data Collection

Readme First does not collect, store, transmit, or share any user data. The extension:

- Does not collect personal information
- Does not collect browsing history
- Does not collect usage statistics
- Does not use analytics or tracking
- Does not use cookies
- Does not communicate with any external servers

How the Extension Works

The extension runs entirely within your browser. It executes a content script on GitHub pages that modifies the page layout by moving existing DOM
elements. All processing happens locally on your device. No data leaves your browser.

Permissions

The extension requires access to github.com solely to modify the page layout. This permission is used exclusively to reposition the README section and
for no other purpose.

Third Parties

Readme First does not share any data with third parties because no data is collected.

Changes to This Policy

Any updates to this privacy policy will be reflected with a new "Last updated" date.
